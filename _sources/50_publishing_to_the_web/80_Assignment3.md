# Assignment 3 the mystery Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. greatest hitting prospect ever, one of the great age 22 seasons.  However at age 24 he is somewhat average... what has happened?  We will investigate!

1. Create a new repository on github for your personal work.  Add a simple index.html, and enable github pages.  

2. Install the pybaseball module (see)[https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball]

to install run

pip install pybaseball

3.  Expand your website you created in part 1 by adding more HTML.   

4.  Run the following analysis on 3 players (Vladimir Guerrero jr, Matt Olson, and Aaron Judge)

For each player retrieve data from 2021, 2022, and 2023 separately.

* find the number of hits (hit_distance_sc) over 380 feet for each player for each year.
* find the number of hits with 'launch_speed' over 100 mph for each player for each year.
* For each player make a bar plot of number of hits > 380 feet, and number of hits with launch_speed > 100 for each year
* For each player make a bar plot of average hit distance and launch_speed for each year.
* For each player make a scatter plot of launch_speed vs launch_angle for each year. 

5.  Look into the quarto library as a means to publish the slides online to then show in a big presentation to the President of Baseball operations and the CEO of Rogers Communications (owner of the Blue Jays).  See https://quarto.org/. 

6.  Talk with your team-mates about the class project.  In this project you have to find your own data (health data?) now that we know a little about APIs and how to publish to the web let's find some more data and test them a bit.  We will soon be preparing a big presentation for the Surgeon General about health outcomes in the North Eastern U.S.
