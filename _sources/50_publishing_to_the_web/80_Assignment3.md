# Assignment 3 the mystery Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. greatest hitting prospect ever, one of the great age 22 seasons.  However at age 24 he is somewhat average... what has happened?  We will investigate!


1. Create a new repository on github for your personal work.  Enable  

2. Install the pybaseball module (see)[https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball]

to install run

pip install pybaseball

2.  Work together to try and figure out why Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was not as good in 2023.  Compare his batted ball stats to his 2021 stats.  Also compare to other players like Aaron Judge.  Discuss with your team-mates what stats are available from the ```statscast.batter``` function and how you use them.

3.  Create some python notebooks to show what has happened to to Vladimir.  Notebooks should be a combination of code and markdown blocks that tell a story.  Potentially create

* histogram of batted ball distance in 2021, 2022, and 2023
* same for Aaron Judge and Matt Olson in 2021, 2022, and 2023
* think of how to deal with different numbers of games played and opportunities (normalize data)
* histograms of exit velocity, same players same years.

think of other plots and data extractions to tell the story.

4.  Look into the quarto library as a means to publish the slides online to then show in a big presentation to the President of Baseball operations and the CEO of Rogers Communications (owner of the Blue Jays).  See https://quarto.org/. 

5.  Talk with your team-mates about the class project.  In this project you have to find your own data (health data?) now that we know a little about APIs and how to publish to the web let's find some more data and test them a bit.  We will soon be preparing a big presentation for the Surgeon General about health outcomes in the North Eastern U.S.
