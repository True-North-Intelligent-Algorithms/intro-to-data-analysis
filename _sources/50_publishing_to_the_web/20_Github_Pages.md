## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a feature provided by GitHub that allows users to host websites directly from their GitHub repositories. When you create a GitHub Pages repository, it provides a URL in the format `https://username.github.io/repository`, where "username" is your GitHub username and "repository" is the name of the repository. You can use GitHub Pages to host personal websites, project documentation, blogs, or any static web content.

### How to Create a GitHub Pages Site

1. Create a new repository or use an existing one for your web content.
2. Ensure your repository contains an `index.html` file as the main entry point for your website. You can also add other HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to build your site.
3. Go to your repository's settings.
4. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
5. Choose the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (usually the `main` or `master` branch).
6. Click on the "Save" button to enable GitHub Pages for your repository.
7. GitHub will provide a URL where your site will be accessible, usually in the format `https://username.github.io/repository`.

### Sample `index.html` for Testing

Here's a simple `index.html` file that you can use for testing purposes:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Test Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple test page.</p>
</body>
</html>
