2.  Start Jupyter Notebook  
3.  It will launch in a web browser.  The web-browser should show all the files and directories in your home folder.  
4.  In the web browser browse to the 'inf-428-data-analytics' folder (the folder you cloned from github), then browse to 'python/notebooks/introduction/ and open PythonNotebookHelloWorld.ipynb.   

5.  Alternatively you can get [Python notebook hello world](https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/introduction/PythonNotebookHelloWorld.ipynb)  directly from the web. 
2.  Run the first cell of the notebook.
