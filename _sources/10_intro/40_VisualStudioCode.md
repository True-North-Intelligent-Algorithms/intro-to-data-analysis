# Visual Studio Code

Install visual studio code [from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio Code is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  It can be used as a means to edit and test your code and is a more powerful alternative to editing Jupyter Notebooks in the web browser.  

It features

* An explorer to allow you to easily access files from complicated multi-directory project structures.
* Integrated source control (access Git via the Visual Explorer GUI)
* Means to run and debug your code
    - debuggers allow you to step through code one line at a time and inspect variable values.  It is a useful way to track down bugs.
* In Visual Studio Code we can install Extensions to support different languages, and provide additional functionality (like AI helpers)
