## Fork and clone class repository from GitHub

### Create a github account

First (if you don't already have a github account) create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). (If you are comfortable with the command line, you can interact with git from there... though many students prefer the desk top application)

### Fork the class repository

Forking makes a copy of a repository on your personal github account.  This is useful if you want to experiment with making changes to a github repository.  

Sign into your github account then go to the following url

https://github.com/True-North-Intelligent-Algorithms/intro-to-data-analysis

Press the 'fork' button near the top right hand side of the page.

### Clone to local machine

Clone moves code from github (which is on 'the cloud') to your local machine.  Cloning is different than forking.  Forking moves code to your github account, but the code is still on the cloud.  Cloning moves code to your local machine. 

The next series of steps will allow you to clone (copy) the code to your local machine. 

### Go to Options

Once you have GitHub desktop running open the ```options``` dialog.

###  Choose the 'URL' tab and enter 

Note: You need to replace __YOURUSERNAME__ with the your won github user name, 

Repository URL: https://github.com/__YOURUSERNAME_/intro-to-data-analysis

Local Path: __The path where you want to put the repository__

Note: Make sure 'Local Path' is in your user directory (in my case it is C:\Users\bnort\INF428') so you can find the files from Python notebook.
