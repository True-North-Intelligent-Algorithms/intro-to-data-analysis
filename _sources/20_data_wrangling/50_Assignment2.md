# Assignment 2

Individual Assignment: 14 Points
 
Purpose of assignment: 

Learn to join datasets  
Learn to create groups  
Learn to analyze groups for trends  
Learn to plot data from groups  

Background

Two years ago NIKE introduced a new shoe called the 4%, that was advertised as improving running times by 4%.  Very quickly almost all elite athletes began using the new shoe.  In this assignment you will look at data from 2013 and 2015 (before the new shoe waas introduced) and 2018 and 2019 (at which point the majority of athletes were using the new shoe).  

You will group this data in an attempt to identify how running times changed for elite athletes after the introduction of the new shoe. 

You will need the following datasets, men2013.txt, men2015.txt, men2018.txt, mean2019.txt, women2013.txt, women2015.txt, women2018.txt, and women2019.txt.  

The datasets can be found on github here  

https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/data_wrangling/

You will use the following notebook as a reference  

https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/data_wrangling/MarathonShoes.ipynb  

Answer the following questions in a word document and submit on BlackBoard  

1.  In the example we use ```pd.read_fwf``` to open data.  What is the ```pd.read_fwf``` function??  Why do we use it in this case instead of ```pd.read_csv```??  
2.  Why do we pass an extra parameter called ```name``` (hint for help on the ```pd.read_fwf``` function call ```help(pd.read_fwf```, it should list all the optional parameters)  
3.  Why do we call ```.head(numRunnersToAnalyze()``` at the end of each ```read_fwf``` call??  (hint try changing the parameter numRunnersToAnalyze to 10 and rerun the notebook)
4.  Modify the notebook so that we also read the men and women datasets from 2013 and 2018 (hint you will have to copy and paste a bit).  Run the notebook over and take a screen shot.  After this modification you should have stats for years 2013 and 2018 in addition to 2015 and 2019.    
5.  Change the ```numRunnersToAnalyze``` parameter to 10 and rerun the notebook.  Take a screen shot.  Are the trends in performance for the top 10 different than the top 100?? 
6.  What does the following block do??  what is ```def``` used for??  Why is there no output when you run the block?
``` python
def timeToSeconds(time):
    temp=time.split(':')
    return 3600*int(temp[0])+60*int(temp[1])+int(temp[2])
```
7.  What does the below block do??  What is ```apply``` (hint run ```help(final['time'].apply)```).  (hint 2 - look at the dataframe ```final``` before and after calling ```apply```)
``` python
final['seconds']=final['time'].apply(lambda x: timeToSeconds(x))
```
8.  Output the ```final``` dataframe to a csv file and import it into KNIME (take a screen shot)  
9.  Rerun the groupby operation in KNIME, but groupby country and aggregate the mean of time in seconds (take a screen shot).  
10.  In Python make a barplot showing the average time of each of the 8 groups of runners. (It is one line of code once you have the groups).
11.  In KNIME make a barplot showing the average time of runners from each country (hint use the KNIME Javascript barplot and follow this [example](https://bnorthan.github.io/inf-428-data-analytics-online/Module4/KNIMEJavaScript), make sure you use 'country' for the 'Category Column' )


(Submit a screen shot) 

BONUS

12.  Repeat block 1 of the Python notebook (where we open and concatenate data, in KNIME).  You will have to figure out how to add column headers in KNIME, how to open (or select) only the first 100 rows, and how to concatenate data.  At the end of the process you should have a larger file which combines all years and genders of the data.  Take a screen shot of the work flow and final table, and insert into the word document.
