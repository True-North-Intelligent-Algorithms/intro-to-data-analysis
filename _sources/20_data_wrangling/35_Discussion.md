# Discussion 2

For module 4 we will be doing an assignment on visualization.  You will be required to choose a topic and make several visualizations.  You will be required to write up a short report on your topic and use the visualizations to tell a story.  Think of it as "practice" for real life scenarios.   For example pretend you work for a baseball team and are comparing several baseball players that your team may be interested in trading for.  Or pretend you work for a city and you nedd to report crime rates for different zipcodes in the city.  If you are a grad student you can use data that is relevant for your thesis project. 

For the module 3 discussion choose a topic for your project, find some example data and post it.   If you can't find data at least post your topic.  

1.  If you have a complicated dataset ask other students for suggestions on how to simplify and clean it. 
2.  Give other students advice on how they can clean their data.
3.  Give other students advice and ideas as to where to find additional datasets for their project.
