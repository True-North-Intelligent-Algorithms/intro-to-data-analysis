# Why Statistics ?

* Summarize raw data
* Compute metrics like mean and standard deviation
* test significance

# Why test significance ?

* Formalizes the process of "detecting" how strong relationships are
* Recent example:  Does a Vaccine prevent Covid ?
* What if 15000 got the Placebo and 200 of them got COVID and 15000 got the Vaccine and only 20 got COVID?  Seems pretty obvious that it works and that is a good thing. 
* But what if only 150 got the Placebo and 4 of them got COVID and 150 got the Vaccine and only 2 got Covid?  hmmmm... maybe it works, twice as many got Covid in the Placebo Group.  But it would help to a formal way to test. 
* That is why we need formal statistical tests.
