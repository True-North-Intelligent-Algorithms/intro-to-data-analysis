# Visualization with Python via Matplotlib 

We will learn visualization with Python a few different ways.  Each way is demonstrated using a series of notebooks. 

## Visualization with Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python.  Use Matplotlib to plot Python structures such as lists and arrays.   The Matplotlib documentation can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/) and a matplotlib gallery can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html).
