# Other Algorithms  

Below is a brief description of some other machine learning algorithms.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  To do machine learning justice requires a full course dedicated to the topic.  

This [notebook](https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/machine_learning/DiabetesKNearestNeighbors.ipynb) shows how to run three different Machine Learning algorithms (K Nearest Neighbors, Naive Baye's, and Logistic Regression) on the same dataset.  

## Decision Trees (Like 20 Questions)

[Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)  

* One person thinks of an object  
* Other players ask yes or no questions  
  * each time splitting the set of objects  
* Starting Point - all objects  
* End point - the object  

## Naive Bayes

* NAIVE BAYES  
* Classifies using Bayes Theorem  
* [Wikipedia Baye's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem#Statement_of_theorem)    
* [Wikpedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)  

## Logistic Regression  

[Wikipedia explation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)  

* This is a machine learning technique that uses optimization to find coefficients. 
* class labels can be expressed as y_ = f(w1*x1 + w2*x2 + w3*x3... wn*xn)  
* Optimization is used to find the weight vector that optimizes the classification error.  
* Many other machine learning techniques are based on this type of optimization, including neural networks.
