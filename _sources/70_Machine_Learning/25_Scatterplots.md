# Scatter plots

In machine learning scatterplot are very useful for looking at the relationship between features and classes.  

* Each sample is a point on the graph.  
* Each class can be assigned a color or label.  
* By inspecting the plot we can judge whether 2 features do a good job at separating classes.  

For example below we have two classes a and b... They are well separated in x and y space... meaning the two features do a good job at identifying each class.

Here we have three classes represented by red, green and blue.  In this case two features do a pretty good job of separating the classes, but it isn't perfect.  There is still overlap.
