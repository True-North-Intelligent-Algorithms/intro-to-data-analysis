## What is Machine Learning ?

* Automated pattern analysis  
* Learning models from examples  
* Using models to make classifications or predictions  

## Examples    

* Search Engines  
  * Every time you click a link the search engine learns what results a person finds useful and moves them to the top...  of course this can be "self-fulfilling"    
* Credit risk analysis  
    * In this application a computer system would predict whether someone is a good bet to pay back a loan.  
* Face recognition  
  * In this application a computer identifies a person based on their picture.
