### Assignment

Machine Learning  

Compile all answers in a word document.  For questions that require Python notebooks or KNIME workflows submit a screen shot. 

The data needed for the assignment is [here](https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/tree/master/python/notebooks/machine_learning)  

dataingdata.csv - this is the dating data.  Should be ready for Machine Learning in KNIME.  May need to convert the 'does she like' column for processing with Python.    

[titanic data](https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/machine_learning/titanic_data.csv) - is the original titanic data.  Useful starting point for Python.  [This notebook](https://github.com/bnorthan/inf-428-data-analytics-online/blob/master/python/notebooks/machine_learning/TitanicToNumeric.ipynb) shows additional preprocessing steps that may be needed.  

titanic_preprocessed.csv - it the titanic data with some preprocessing done to deal with missing data.  Use this for the titanic question.  (note more preprocessing may be needed)   

1. Explain why we divide data into testing and training sets. (1 point)    

2. A class takes a test and the entire class does horrible.  The prof gives them a second chance.  The next week   a) The prof gives them the exact same test over again, same questions, same answers.  The students do well this time.  Have they really learned anything?  b) Alternatively the prof give them a slightly different test on the same material.  Different questions but on the same concepts.  The students do well this time.  Have they learned anything?   c) Explain how this anecdote relates to the concept of 'self prediction'   See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fxB3XPY0CU) for hints.  (1 point)  

3.  In Python how do we divide data into training and testing sets? (1 point) 

4.  Explain what overfitting is. (the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fxB3XPY0CU) referenced in part 2 may also be useful here)  (1 point)  

5.  Make a scatter plot of some of the indian-diabetes data using distinct types of points (for example distinct colors) for each class.  Find two features (columns) that visually do a good job of separating the data - 2 points.  Submit screen shot.   (use KNIME or Python)

6.  Describe K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm in words.  Also take the notebook 38_KNearest_dating.ipynb and add documentation (markdown) cells to explain what each python cell is doing.  You can also add python comments in the python cells to make each step clearer.  (submit  word doc or e-mail) and  -1 points  

7.  Perform classification with scikit-learn k-nearest neighbors and scikit-learn Naive Bayes algorithm on the dating dataset and titanic dataset remember to divide into training and testing - 4 points  

	For the dating dataset “did_she_like” is the class.
		Report accuracy of the algorithm 
	For the titanic dataset “survived” is the class
		Report accuracy of the algorithm 

	For both embed a screenshot of the workflow

8. Perform classification with Scikitlearn k-nearest neighbors  on the dating and titanic dataset, remember to divide into training and testing- 4 points  

9. In class we have sometimes been testing our algorithms on extremely simple datasets.  Datasets so simple that a human can see what the answer is right away.  Why is it useful to test an algorithm on a very simple dataset??  (1 point)   (See python/machineLearning/DiabetesMachineLearning.ipynb)

10.  We have two classes of drink.  We know they are either Cola or Coffee.   We measure the following features   
Temperature  
% carbonation  

Is this a good design??  When will a classifier based on these features succeed??  When will it fail??   (1 point)
